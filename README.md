PostgreSQL.Bulk is designed to provide a fast wrapper around the Npgsql's `BinaryImporter` class which allows the insertion of Data in a bulk  fashion. It will allows you to easily insert millions of rows at once with or without foreign tables.

## About

This packages aims to provide near native speed of calling the `BinaryImporter` methods, while providing automatic mapping of columns and much more. This removes the need of writing long boiler code for every Entity (Table).

## Installation

Currently the package is still at the development of its core components and therefor not yet ready for a stable release. However once ready, it will be distributed via NuGet.

## Example

For the first Step, you will need to create a Model which represents a given table inside your PostgreSQL Database. For the sake of this example, we will create two models, one for our Person and one for its E-Mail addresses.

```c#
public class Person
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }

    public string Name { get; set; }

    public List<Email> Emails { get; set; }
}

public class Email
{
    public Guid Id { get; set; }

    public string Address { get; set; }
    
    public Guid PersonId { get; set; }
}
```

As you can see those two entities belong together, hence the `List<Email>`. In order to tell the package that, you will need to add an `EntityConfiguration` for the Person. 

The `MapGuidGenerator` will tell the package to generate a new `Guid` for the primary key, if none was defined. This could also be achieved by using the `MapValueFactory` method. Whereas `MapOneToMany`, will tell the package that if your Person has Emails, they should be inserted as well. This also specifies that the `Person.Id` should get copied over to the `PersonId`. 

```c#
public class PersonConfiguration : EntityConfiguration<Person>
{
    protected override void Configure(EntityBuilder<Person> entityBuilder)
    {
        entityBuilder.MapGuidGenerator(x => x.Id)
            		 .MapOneToMany(x => x.Emails, x => x.Id, x => x.PersonId);
    }
}

public class EmailConfiguration : EntityConfiguration<Email>
{
    protected override void Configure(EntityBuilder<Email> entityBuilder)
    {
        entityBuilder.MapGuidGenerator(x => x.Id);
    }
}
```

Now at the start of our application we would want to call `EntityConfigurator.BuildConfigurations()`, in order to build the configuration we just defined.  For the last step we just need to get some Persons ready and open up a Npgsql connection.

```c#
await using (var connection = new NpgsqlConnection("YourConnectionString"))
{
    await connection.OpenAsync();

    var persons = new List<Person>();

    for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++)
    {
        list.Add(new Person()
                 {
                     Name = "Person Nr." + i.ToString(),
                     Emails = new List<Email> { new Email { Address = "person" + i.ToString() + "@example.com" } }
                 });
    }

    await connection.BulkInsertAsync(persons);
}
```

And that's already it, all items should successfully be inserted to your database, with the appropriately foreign key set.

## How it works

Under the hood this package relies heavily on compiled expressions and its cache, which allow for near native performance. 
The Cache for a Model will be build under two specific circumstances:

1. You as the user call `EntityConfigurator.BuildConfigurations` on your own, with all the assemblies which contain the `EntityConfiguration` classes. This should preferably be called at the start of your application. _(recommended way)_
2. If for some reason the `EntityConfigurator.BuildConfigurations` method wasn't called, it will perform the build of all the configurations found in the current assembly, once you call `BulkInsertAsync` for the first time. Note that this will obviously slow down the first call of `BulkInsertAsync`, by a lot. _(not recommended way)_

#### Internal Behaviours

- Table names - are automatically generated by the name of the Entity with an 's' appended, if not appropriate call `MapToTable` 
- Column names - are automatically generated by the name of the Property inside the entity, if not appropriate call `MapToColumn` 
- The following attributes which are defined in `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations.Schema` are supported:
  - `NotMapped`
  - `Table`
  - `Column`
